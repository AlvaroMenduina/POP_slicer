# POP_slicer

Physical Optics Propagation (POP) analysis of Image Slicers for ELT-HARMONI and ELT-PCS.

## Methodology

POP analysis is done using Zemax. The output is a set of Zemax Beam Files (ZBF), one for each of the Slices within the Image Slicer. Those files are loaded with Python and post-processed to generate a single PSF.
